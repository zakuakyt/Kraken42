## 12/24/2025 2:26 PM - Picking parts + Schematic  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

Finally got around to this project since it's winter break. The plan is to do a corne but with my own twist. Wireless, no connection between the 2 so I will have to use ZMK.
I'll use a NRF52840 board, kailh choc v1 switches(no hotswap though), hopefully some nice keycaps if possible, a 3.7V LiPo and of course diodes.

Now it's time for the schematic.
I loosely followed the guide but heres what I came up with.

I decided to add a 0.91" OLED and a reset button.
  

## 12/24/2025 2:31 PM - PCB Left side routing  

_Time spent: 8.0h_  

This took so long especially since I was afraid to use vias at first idk why.
I also did the footprints and everything, made staggered columns, and placed the thumb keys.

I also added some images to fit the theme.

## 12/24/2025 2:39 PM - Right Side of PCB  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

This was simple but tedious, same thing just different wiring. I also changed the octopus positioning so it wouldnt just be an exact copy of the left side.

## 12/24/2025 7 PM - Minor PCB changes  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

Had some DRC problems, also forgot to switch to THT diodes on one side so I had to add and wire them. Other than that I did some silkscreen changes, and now the pcbs are ready.

I didnt worry too much about this step since I can reprint myself if needed.




  

## 12/25/2025 8:13 PM - ZMK config  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

QMK doesnt support wireless splits so I decided to use zmk. There is some learning but the docs are great as mention in @koeg 's tutorial. Here's the keymap.
